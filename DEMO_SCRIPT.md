# 🏆 NEURIX: The Winning Hackathon Demo Script (3:00)

**Target Tracks:** 🧠 The Marathon Agent (Reliability) & 🎨 Creative Autopilot (Multimodal)
**Speaker Tone:** High energy, fast-paced, authoritative.

### 0:00 - 0:40 | The Hook & The Architecture
**(Visual: Start on the blank 'Ready' screen. Mouse hovers over the 'NEURIX OS' badge.)**

"Hi, I'm [Your Name], and this is **NEURIX**."

"We all know the problem: AI Agents today are 'Black Boxes.' You type a prompt, stare at a loading spinner, and pray the output works. If it fails, you have no idea why."

**(Visual: Type: "Create a hackathon website for a cyberpunk coding event".)**

"NEURIX is different. It is a **Transparent Autonomous Reasoning Engine** powered entirely by the **Gemini 3 Model Family**. It doesn't just stream text; it architects, executes, and verifies complex workflows right in front of your eyes."

---

### 0:40 - 1:20 | Automatic Agent Switching
**(Visual: Click 'INITIATE'. The Graph explodes onto the screen. Point to the different colored nodes.)**

"First, notice the **Automatic Agent Switching**. The system isn't using one model for everything."

"The **Planner (NEXUS)** uses **Gemini 3 Pro** for deep reasoning to build this graph. But for the coding steps, it automatically hot-swaps to **Gemini 3 Flash** for speed. And for this visual asset step? It switches to the **Nano Banana Pro** model."

"It optimizes for cost and intelligence at every single node, completely autonomously."

---

### 1:20 - 2:00 | Live Injection & Artifacts
**(Visual: Click 'EXECUTE'. As nodes turn green, click on a Code Node. Open the 'Artifacts' tab. Click the 'Live Preview' eye icon.)**

"But here’s the magic. We have a **Live Artifact Runtime**."

**(Visual: The modal opens showing the rendered Hackathon Website running perfectly.)**

"NEURIX renders the code instantly in a secure sandbox. I can verify the website works without leaving the agent."

**(Visual: Quickly open the 'Edit Plan' / Workflow Editor.)**

"And if I change my mind? I can pause execution, **Inject New Steps** mid-flight, and resume. The agent adapts to *my* workflow, not the other way around."

---

### 2:00 - 2:40 | Error Handling, Self-Healing & QA
**(Visual: Close modal. Show the 'QA Phase' active at the end.)**

"Finally, reliability. Meet **AXION**, our Verifier Agent."

"AXION audits every step. If Gemini generates broken code, AXION catches it and triggers a **Self-Healing Branch**—automatically adding 'Fix-It' nodes to repair the error."

**(Visual: Show the final 'QA PASSED' score in the logs.)**

"We end every run with a rigorous QA Score. If it’s not perfect, it doesn't ship."

---

### 2:40 - 3:00 | Conclusion
**(Visual: Zoom out on the full completed graph. Show the System Monitor graph.)**

"NEURIX transforms AI from a magic trick into a reliable engineering tool. By combining the reasoning depth of **Gemini 3** with a self-correcting visual architecture, we've built an agent you can actually trust."

"This is NEURIX. Thank you."
