# 🏆 NEURIX: The Winning Hackathon Demo Script (3:00)

**Target Tracks:** 🧠 The Marathon Agent (Reliability) & 🎨 Creative Autopilot (Multimodal)
**Speaker Tone:** High energy, fast-paced, authoritative.

### 0:00 - 0:40 | The Hook & The Architecture
**(Visual: Start on the blank 'Ready' screen. Mouse hovers over the 'NEURIX OS' badge.)**

"Hi, I'm [Your Name], and this is **NEURIX**."

"We all know the problem: AI Agents today are 'Black Boxes.' You type a prompt, stare at a loading spinner, and pray the output works. If it fails, you have no idea why."

**(Visual: Upload an image file - e.g., a whiteboard sketch. Type: "Build a landing page based on this sketch, write 3 marketing tweets, and generate a hero image.")**

"NEURIX is different. It’s a **Transparent Autonomous Reasoning Engine** powered entirely by the **Gemini 3 Model Family**. It doesn't just stream text; it architects, executes, and verifies complex workflows right in front of your eyes."

---

### 0:40 - 1:20 | Track 1: The Marathon Agent (Planning & Thinking)
**(Visual: Click 'INITIATE'. Show the status change to 'Generating Workflow'. Point to the log showing "Thinking Budget" or "Gemini 3 Pro".)**

"For the **Marathon Agent** track, reliability is key. Unlike standard chatbots, NEURIX uses **Gemini 3 Pro** with `thinkingBudget` enabled to *plan* before it acts."

**(Visual: The Graph explodes onto the screen. Mouse over the nodes showing parallel paths.)**

"Watch this. It generates a **Directed Acyclic Graph**. It knows it can write the code and generate the marketing copy in parallel. It’s not guessing; it’s engineering. We use specific personas: **NEXUS** for planning and **VORTEX** for coding, leveraging Gemini's huge context window to keep the whole project state in memory."

---

### 1:20 - 2:00 | Track 2: Creative Autopilot (Multimodal & Artifacts)
**(Visual: Steps turn green/running. Click on a 'Creation' node (Image Generation). Show the image appearing in the side panel.)**

"For the **Creative Autopilot** track, we're using **Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview** (Nano Banana Pro) to generate high-fidelity assets on the fly."

**(Visual: Click on the 'Code' node. Then click the 'Artifacts' tab on the right. Hover over the 'Live Preview' eye icon.)**

"But here’s the magic. We don't just generate code blocks. We have a **Live Artifact Runtime**."

**(Visual: Click the eye icon. The modal opens showing the rendered HTML/Game running perfectly.)**

"NEURIX renders the code Gemini wrote instantly in a secure sandbox. I can verify the landing page works without ever leaving the agent. This shortens the loop between 'Idea' and 'Shippable Product' to seconds."

---

### 2:00 - 2:40 | Reliability: Self-Healing & QA
**(Visual: Close the modal. Show the 'QA Phase' active at the end of the graph.)**

"Finally, how do we ensure stability? Meet **AXION**, our Verifier Agent."

**(Visual: Show the Log Viewer. Highlight a "Verification Passed" or "Self-Correction" log.)**

"AXION audits every step. If Gemini generates broken code, AXION catches it and triggers a **Self-Healing Branch**—automatically adding new nodes to fix the error. It sleeps with one eye open."

**(Visual: Show the final 'QA PASSED' score in the logs.)**

"We end every run with a rigorous QA Score. If it’s not an 85 or higher, it doesn't ship."

---

### 2:40 - 3:00 | Conclusion
**(Visual: Zoom out on the full completed graph. Show the System Monitor graph.)**

"NEURIX transforms AI from a magic trick into a reliable engineering tool. By combining the reasoning depth of **Gemini 3** with a self-correcting visual architecture, we've built an agent you can actually trust."

"This is NEURIX. Thank you."
